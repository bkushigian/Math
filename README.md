# README for bMath

Hi, I'm Ben, and this is my math. It's pretty empty right now, but I'll be
adding things to it. I have all sorts of math, but I need to make sure they're
good mathz and not bad mathz before I put them here. Some mathz will be
experimental mathz, and they will be in the Experimental folder.
